### Hi there! I'm Christian 👋🏼 👨🏼‍💻

I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering and am currently immersed in the world of software development as a mobile developer. However, my thirst for knowledge is unending, and I'm always eager to explore new tools and technologies that will enrich my career journey. I have a particular interest in AI and blockchain development, and I'm constantly seeking ways to leverage my experience to stay ahead of emerging trends.
